      <h2>4. Competitor Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Regional competitors such as “NY Stitch Co.” and “Sage & Thread” are rapidly expanding through influencer collaborations and product drops. However, your direct-to-community style and curated lookbook approach remain distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most competitors struggle with retention. Your edge is stronger post-sale engagement — but can improve with gamified loyalty.
      </p>
